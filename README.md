# AIAgent

AIAgent is a flexible framework designed to facilitate the creation and deployment of AI agents using the agency-swarm library. This project provides a powerful, modular structure for developing intelligent agents capable of tackling a wide range of tasks across various domains.

Key Features

Scalability: Build and manage multiple agents seamlessly.

Modularity: Easily customize agent behaviors and roles for different projects.

Integration: Leverage agency-swarm to optimize collaboration between agents.

Extensibility: Add new functionality to agents with minimal effort.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

agency-swarm library

Any additional libraries required by specific use cases (to be updated as needed)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIAgent.git
cd AIAgent

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

Define your agents in the agents/ directory by creating configuration files or Python scripts.

Customize the config.yaml file to specify project-specific parameters, such as the number of agents, their roles, and behaviors.

Usage

Start the framework:

python main.py

Monitor and interact with agents via the built-in interface or API.
